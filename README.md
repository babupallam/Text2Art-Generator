## 🛠 **Implementation Specifications**

This project is a **Flask-based Text2Art-Generator** that utilizes a **text-to-image generation model** to create AI-generated images based on user prompts.

#### 🔹 **Model Used**
- The implementation uses **Stable Diffusion / DALLE-2** (or other text-to-image models).
- The model is capable of generating **high-quality AI-generated images** from natural language descriptions.
- It uses **diffusion models**, which iteratively refine an image from noise using a trained deep learning model.

#### 🔹 **Image Quality & Configurations**
The image generation quality is optimized using the following parameters:

| Parameter            | Description                                      | Default Value |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `num_inference_steps` | Number of iterations the model takes to refine the image. Higher values improve quality but increase processing time. | **50** |
| `guidance_scale`     | Controls how much the generated image aligns with the input text. Higher values make it more accurate to the prompt. | **7.5** |
| `image_size`         | Determines the resolution of the output image (e.g., **512x512, 768x768**). | **512x512** |
| `sampling_method`    | Defines the method used for image generation (e.g., **DDIM, PLMS, Euler A**). | **DDIM** |
| `seed`              | Enables reproducibility of generated images. If set to `None`, each image is unique. | **Random** |

#### 🔹 **Performance Optimizations**
- Optimized for **low-memory environments** by using **float16 precision** where applicable.
- Runs **asynchronously** to prevent UI freezing during image generation.
- Supports **both CPU and GPU execution** depending on system resources.

#### 🔹 **Generated Image Storage & Retrieval**
- **Generated images** are stored in **/generated_Images/** for easy retrieval.
- Filenames are dynamically created based on **user prompts**, making them searchable.
- A **gallery system** is implemented, allowing users to **view, enlarge, and download** images.

First, clone this GitHub repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/babupallam/Text2Art-Generator.git
cd Text2Art-Generator
```

---

### **2️⃣ Set Up a Virtual Environment**
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

#### **For Windows (Command Prompt / PowerShell)**
```sh
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
#### **For macOS / Linux**
```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### **3️⃣ Install Dependencies**
Once the virtual environment is activated, install all required dependencies using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This ensures that Flask, AI models, and all necessary libraries are installed.

---

### **4️⃣ Run the Flask Backend**
Start the backend server using:
```sh
python backend/app.py
```
The server will start, and you should see an output like:
```
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

---

### **5️⃣ Open the Frontend**
Now, open `index.html` in your browser (inside the `frontend` folder). Alternatively, you can start a simple HTTP server:
```sh
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then, visit **http://127.0.0.1:8000/** in your browser.

---

### **6️⃣ Generate Images**
- Enter a text prompt and click **"Generate"**.
- The AI model will process the input and generate an image.
- You can view the latest generated image or browse previously created images in the gallery.
- Click on an image to view it in full size and download it.

---

### **7️⃣ Stopping the Server**
To stop the Flask server, press `CTRL + C` in the terminal.
